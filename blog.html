  <h2>HTML</h2>
  <p>HTML Slot is one of the most remarkable standards made by W3C. Combine that with another impressive W3C standard called templates, and you have a fabulous concoction to work with. Being able to create and add HTML elements to a page using JavaScript is a necessary and important task.
  It’s useful when a code snippet has to appear only at certain times, or when you don’t want to type out hundreds of similarly structured HTML elements but want to automize the process.
  Creating HTML elements in JavaScript is not so desirable. It’s a hassle having to check and recheck if you have covered all the tags, placed them in the right order, all in all, there is just too much to type and keep track of. This turmoil, however, got a solution when the tag appeared. If something needs to be added to the page dynamically, you can put it inside of the element.
  In this post, I will show you how you can use the and tags together with JavaScript to create a mini HTML table factory that can create and populate hundreds of similar tables.</p>

  <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
  <p>The design of mobile web layouts for smartphones poses a challenge for designers time and time again. The little space available on the devices has to be used in a meaningful way – mostly for the content. Thus, it would be best if the navigation took up no space at all, while still being easy and intuitive to find. The following examples show you suggestions where to place the navigation in your mobile web designs.Those that don’t want to hide the entire navigation outside of the viewport will surely enjoy the following navigation. It’s a classic horizontal navigation with the menu items sorted by priority – as it should be anyway. The first menu item is the most important one. The other items follow in descending significance.Since, especially with extensive websites, it is unlikely that all menu items will fit into navigation, you simply hide everything that doesn’t fit in, and add a “more” button at the end of the navigation. Behind that, there’s a drop-down menu containing all the remaining links of your navigation.
  The advantage is that not the entire navigation is hidden. Everything that fits is displayed. Usually, all the most important menu items are displayed. This flexible navigation is a mix of completely visible, and completely hidden.</p>

  <h2>CSS</h2>
  <p>When using any new CSS, the question of browser support has to be addressed. This is even more of a consideration when new CSS is used for layout as with Flexbox and CSS Grid, rather than things we might consider an enhancement.
  When using any new CSS, the question of browser support has to be addressed. This is even more of a consideration when new CSS is used for layout as with Flexbox and CSS Grid, rather than things we might consider an enhancement.
  In this article, I explore approaches to dealing with browser support today. What are the practical things we can do to allow us to use new CSS now and still give a great experience to the browsers that don’t support it?</p>
